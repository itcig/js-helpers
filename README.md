## Usage

[TBD...]

## Local Development

### Testing

Run `yarn run test` from inside the project's root

When using in the monorepo make sure to run `yarn run build` inside of the
eslint-config-cig package (there's an issue with yarn 1.\* building in
workspaces... or something like that per Brad)
